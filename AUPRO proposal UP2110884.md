-  Voice Changer

# Project Ideas in 1 Sentence:


3D Spatial Audio Processorâ€”I will create a system that can play sounds according to where they are in a 3D space. For example, Conflicting sounds will appear when the mouse is on the opposite side of the screen. I would then add more detailed scenarios and parameters to change the sound.
-  Real-Time Audio Effects Controller - This will act like a synthesizer where the user can input files or speak in real-time and will be able to apply effects and filters to experiment with audio. 
-  Voice Transformation Tool - Similar to the last example this would involve a live voice input and the user can use an interface to manipulate and record their voice.
-  Instrumental Synth - I will create an interface that would allow the user to control different instruments and coordinate parameters which can then be applied to the sound.
-  Live Audio Looper - This would be a tool that would either take audio files or live feed audio and would allow the user to create a sound track by looping the same track.




# Describe the theme or key idea behind your project
A feedback delay with controllable filters which changes its parameters in real-time to challenge the performer.

# Project research
Feedback delay is a commo

# Project development

## What do you anticipate them to hear?

The user will hear the live audio that is being played, augmented by at least one delay line with feedback, a filter, and distortion. At least one parameter will be randomised.

## How will they interact with your software?

There will be a simple UI with minimal controls. As with a mechanical delay, the user can set starting values but the actual delay parameters may change.

## What unique features does your software offer them?

The delay tool is deliberately designed to be variable in operation, leading to unexpected output. The musician will need to listen, and respond, to the output in real-time.

# List the input sources you will be using

Real-time input - testing will use an electric guitar as live input.

# List the output sources you will be using

Real-time audio output

# List how you will enable real-time control

SuperCollider GUI
