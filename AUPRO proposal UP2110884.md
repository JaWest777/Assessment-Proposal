# Describe the theme or key idea behind your project
A feedback delay with controllable filters which changes its parameters in real-time to challenge the performer.

# Project research
Feedback delay is a commo

# Project development

## What do you anticipate them to hear?

The user will hear the live audio that is being played, augmented by at least one delay line with feedback, a filter, and distortion. At least one parameter will be randomised.

## How will they interact with your software?

There will be a simple UI with minimal controls. As with a mechanical delay, the user can set starting values but the actual delay parameters may change.

## What unique features does your software offer them?

The delay tool is deliberately designed to be variable in operation, leading to unexpected output. The musician will need to listen, and respond, to the output in real-time.

# List the input sources you will be using

Real-time input - testing will use an electric guitar as live input.

# List the output sources you will be using

Real-time audio output

# List how you will enable real-time control

SuperCollider GUI
